1071,NA,Yes,
1273,1983,No,
pm262,1915,No,Two points were deleted at first for a high correlation but when you add points in correlation is still good. Added points and resubmitted form. 
1239,1933,No,
1267,1948,No,
2157,1931,No,
1415,NA,NA,Removed a point that actually made no sense and alignment improved

2129,1969,No,"Dated to 1996 (originally 1998) got rid of 3 added points removed one, improves alignment a lot"

2510,1935,No,
2500,1970,No,
1248,1969,No,
2137,NA,Yes,"Note: whoever did this wrote ""good alignment through 1924"" but 1924 is its last year"
1500,1917,No,
2024,NA,Yes,
2594,1875,No,I also had to turn the uncs into confirmed points and resubmitted a form
2600,1978,No,
1065,1943,No,
2023,NA,No,
1495,1956,no,Two rings were deleted for better alignment but they are clearly rings. I just left it since there's no other way to get good alignment
1494,1988,no,
2037,NA,Yes,Added back the skipped ring and improved alignment throughout core (not sure why deleted in the first place)
1226,NA,Yes,"The rings not included were clearly uncs, the image justified the placing. Good Alignment."
1078,1944,No,
2580,1933,No,Went back in an resolved uncs as well.
2148,1921,No,
2601,1991,No,Removed unc
2031,NA,Yes,Could not find extra/removed ring-- all justifiable
2529,1938,Yes,"Could not find extra ring that didn't make sense (noted in the crossdating progress) and alignment only good through 1938, not 1903"
2584,NA,Yes,"Added back the delted ring, improved alignment throughout (originally limited by chronology, not anymore so I think that was the issue) resubmitted form"
2570,1951,No,
2596,NA,Yes,Could not find incorrect ring 
1256,1969,No,
1080,1940,No,

2116,1950,No,
1275,1991,No,
1273Z,1935,No,
2139,1978,no,multiple rings not counted. tried adding them back and disabling different ones but nothing helped
2508,1978,no,really bad alignment after 1915. potential for better alignment but would have to add two ring and there's no rings to add
1403,1935,no,
2126,2005,no,
2110,1959,no,Not sure if it was intentional but there's a ring with two seperate points on it. Trid disabling it but doesnt really help
1455,NA,Yes,
1448,NA,Yes,"Already reviewed, added ring didn't make sense, removed"
1357Z,NA,Yes,"Deleted added ring, improved alignment"
1084,NA,Yes,"Person originally said the alignment was good through 1968, but core ends at 1970 and there were no added rings like the record states"
1316,NA,Yes,There was an extra point that was not added in cross-dating (mistake with auto I think) and threw off the whole thing.. I fixed it
1447,NA,Yes,"Added back the missing ring, deleted the added ring and improved alignment. Not particualarly good alignment throughout though"
1466,1978,No,
1341,1975,No,
1057,1960,No,Early years and late years are both WAY off-- the person made the middle fit well but the others are not fixed at all
1383,1993,No,
1348,1980,No,
1453,1952,No,"The earliest change is at 1952, but the alignment is only good through 1979 "
1286,1991,No,
1215,NA,Yes,"Resubmitted form to re-date the core (originally dated 2009, with a removed ring and an added ring which both didn't make sense) alignment better"
4038,NA,yes,all rings counted but some points are offset for better correlation in the beginning. Decided to leave it
1019,NA,yes,"There was a ring that was kind of questionable in the middle where the correlation was poor. If you disable it, the correlation improves there without compromising the other areas. Disabled the ring"
1026,2006,no,Disabled an unc at the end. Makes the correlation A LOT better
1311,2004,no,"One random ring not included. If it is, correlation improves. If you change the year, the correlation is good throughout. Added ring and changed year"
4031,1971,no,random ring in middle not included. Alignment really good though if you leave it. Just left it alone
1494,1988,No,
1500,1917,no,
2560,1978,no,deleted two random points and included two rings that weren't originally included. alignment improved in all but one area
1418Z,1936,no,added a ring that wasn't included. Doesn't negatively impact correlation or anything
2587,1978,no,
2524,1978,no,really tough core. There were a couploe double labeled rings and unlabeled. I tried switching them up but the correlation was best as is. Left it alone
1498,NA,yes,Originally noted not good alignment at the end. Rings were sketchy so I disabled them and alignment improved.
2530,1954,no,One random point enabled another ring disabled. Try to fix it but correlation gets compromised. Left as is
2120,1938,No,
2154,1974,No,
2043,NA,Yes,"There was a double-labelled ring, so when I fixed it and put back the removed ring the alignment great as-is"
2046,1995,No,
2091,1975,No,
2085,1943,No,"Without the modifications the end looks better, but the middle looks a lot worse, so I just left it"
1211,1928,no,
2159,1897,No,"All 3 added rings seem plausible (very faint lines within other rings) but the last one is questionable, so I put that one as the date"
1381,1923,No,"Previously dated at 2011, but there was a double labelled ring, and when I fixed it the modifications no longer made sense. Mine make more sense, but the ring I removed still isn't justified."
RESUME HERE1101,NA,Yes,The ring deleted (1933) is justifiably not a ring
1489,NA,Yes,The extra ring actually made alignment way worse. deleting it made sense
2115,2005,No,The extra ring could make sense
2044,NA,Yes,Issue with double point marking 2 separate rings. Fixed it and improved alignment.
2161,1967,No,
2136,1977,No,
1475,NA,Yes,Dated incorrectly-- fixed an incorrect autoplace and improved alignment
2165,1978,No,
1368,NA,Yes,Misplaced auto point removed. Just not a very good core
1089,NA,Yes,Original alignment better without extra point
1036,NA,Yes,2 extra points made alignment worse than original-- deleted
1061,NA,Yes,Extra point did not improve alignment
1476,1990,No,
1056,1967,No,Disabled random point and included a ring that wasn't originally. Correlation didn't change much but it's at least including all rings now
1088,1968,No,
1340,1944,No,Still poor alignment but added a ring and alignment improved a bit at the end
2051,1995,No,
2084,2012,No,
1049,2003,No,
1488,1988,No,Added ring not oiginally included. Correlation does go down but alignment not awful and at least all rings included
1217,1985,No,
1471,1995,no,
1372,1955,no,Added a skipped ring and left an unc. Alignment gets a little better for the last few points. Might be better to leave the way it was but not sure?
1458,NA,yes,Disabled two random rings in auto chain. Alignment instantly got better
1303,1933,No,"Ended up deleting 3 uncs and one of the extra points. improved central alignment, end alignment was never good to begin with"
4014,1982,No,One random point I got rid of then added two faded looking rings. Improves alignment alot at the end but the alignment in the middle is still questionable
1482Z,2009,no,
1319,NA,yes,
pm217,1974,no,Fixed a dual point and added ring. Tough to tell what to do. Left added ring in but alignment poor in one area
pm130,1994,no,Tough core. I deleted an extra point and dated the core to 2011 for better alignment.
1381,1923,no,there was one ring not counted and a random point not too far. thought it would help alignment to change them but didn't. Really only one area with bad alignment
pm77B,2005,no,Aberation type area in the beginning may be hiding a ring but alignment was fine so decided to leave it
pm105,1938,no,left as is
pm266,NA,yes,Just an unc needed to be removed
pm109,1999,no,
pm70,NA,yes,Just an unc
pm64B,2005,no,Played with a few rings but no other way to get good correlation. Left as iss
